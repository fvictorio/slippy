# Why Slippy?

- A single, flexible configuration that lets you easily enable or disable rules for specific parts of your codebase.
- A unified [naming-convention](/slippy/rules/naming-convention) rule.
- A more accurate [`no-unused-vars`](/slippy/rules/no-unused-vars) rule
- Unused comment directives like `// slippy-disable-line` are reported
- No formatting rules
- Semantic versioning
